# Blitz001_FortDefense
 
A Unity/C# game project with a 2 week time limit to hone productivity skills.

Hordes of enemies randomly spawn and travel toward your fort in waves to destroy it. The turrets automatically fire when enemies are in proximity. After each wave, you can upgrade the turrets' damage and fire speed, as well as the fort Hitpoints.
